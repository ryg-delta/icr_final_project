        <h2>Cultural Biases</h2>
        <p>Claim: Cultural biases impact how symptoms and conditions are perceived and communicated between providers and patients. 
            Historical views on gender have shown women as “overemotional” and “dramatic” while men are expected to be stoic when expressing pain.
            These persistent biases make women’s concerns seem less credible, contributing to delays in diagnosis and dismissals of health concerns.</p>
        <p>
            CounterArgument: Healthcare systems and providers have been trained and made aware of gender biases, so the persistent health inequities
             could be attributed to more prominent biases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rebuttal:  Despite current efforts, cultural biases continue to manifest in more subtle ways. 
            For instance, cultural norms and stereotypes often lead women to perceive pain as a normal experience, 
            which can result in their symptoms being overlooked or minimized in clinical settings.

        <h2>Systemic Biases</h2>
        <p>
            The healthcare system often overlooks women’s health in medical training, mostly focusing on health issues through a lens built on hegemony. 
            This gap in education perpetuates biases among providers, resulting in a lack of knowledge and more importantly awareness in women specific health issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Focusing on systemic reform may divert crucial attention from more feasible changes on the institutional level or provider level. 
            There are also other health concerns that affect both men and women that must be considered. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Addressing systemic biases doesn’t detract from addressing health concerns for both men and women, 
            rather it improves the system’s ability to deliver equitable healthcare for all.

    <div id="option3Page" class="page">
        <h2>Institutional Biases</h2>
        <p>
            Historically, medical research has neglected and underfunded studies on female-specific conditions, slowing down advancements in diagnosis and treatment for issues like endometriosis and idiopathic pelvic pain. 
            This neglect has further led to distrust among women regarding their healthcare issues, leading to noncompliance.
        </p>
        <p>
            While institutional bias in healthcare is a well known barrier to communication, the inherent complexity of women's health conditions plays a more substantial role in influencing health outcomes.
            Women's conditions are often multifaceted and difficicult to diagnose, leading to significant delays in diagnoses. This is further exacerbated by patients not complying with provider's orders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Women's health only remains complex due to the lack of funding in research, which leads to distrust towards the system and providers.

        <h2> A Framework Built on Listening.</h2>
        <p>
            To address the shortcomings of women’s health, which stems from several biases and male privilege, 
            a holistic framework which integrates all six principles of intercultural praxis along all levels of communication. 
            This framework will consider Hofstede’s cultural dimension of masculinity/femininity to identify and 
            challenge the cultural, structural and institutional biases that exist within healthcare systems. 
            By applying this framework, it can better improve trust and promote equitable outcomes for women.
        </p>
        <p>
            Improvements in Micro-Level Communciation: Develop Patient-Provider Relationships
            Inquiry: Encourage providers to approach patients with curiosity and openness, recognizing the lived experiences of women, especially those from 
            marginalized backgrounds. 
            Dialogue: Create a safe and trusting environment for women to voice their concerns and to be taken seriously, without being dismissed. 
            Reflection: Providers should be aware of their own biases and assumptions about women’s health, in particular focusing on their own positionality 
            within a male-centric healthcare system, providers can identify their unconscious biases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Improvements in Meso-Level Communication: Rectify Systemic and Organizational Practices
            Framing: Acknowledge how the current healthcare system operates within a cultural context that has historically undervalued women’s health.
            Positioning: Identify the power dynamics between patients and providers, which stem from hegemonic beliefs in the system. 
            Thus, by adopting an intersectional lens, healthcare systems can identify and dismantle communication barriers which affect women
            Action: Include trainings based off the lived experiences of women in medical education to help providers understand how women’s concerns
            are affected in the healthcare system
        </p>
        <p>
            Improvements in Macro-Level Communication: Challenge Institutional Norms
            Dialogue: Raise awareness about women’s health, so that more research funding can go towards uncovering better diagnostic methods and treatments.
            Action: Drive change by raising awareness, increasing funding, and reforming policies.
             Some policies could include accountability measures to track disparities in healthcare outcomes.
